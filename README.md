# Pokemon-Data-Analysis


### Project Overview
Pokémon Stats Analysis is a data-driven project that explores and visualizes various attributes of Pokémon, such as attack, defense, speed, and type distributions. The goal is to derive insights from the dataset and understand trends using data analysis techniques.

### Data Source
Pokemon Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Pokemon.csv" file, containing detailed information about each pokemon.

### Objectives
1. Clean and preprocess the Pokémon dataset

2. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns

3. Visualize key attributes like Pokémon type distributions, attack vs. defense, and speed comparisons

4. Use clustering or classification to categorize Pokémon based on their stats

### Tools
1. Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn

2. Jupyter Notebook for analysis

### Key Analysis & Insights
1. Distribution of Pokémon Types

2. Correlation between Attack, Defense, and Speed

3. Top Performing Pokémon based on stats

4. Clustering Pokémon based on attributes
